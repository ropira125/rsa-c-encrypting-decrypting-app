This is a simple console application for RSA encryption and decryption in C#.

How to use
Generate public and private keys: Run the program and select option 1. Follow the prompts to generate a public key and a private key.

Encrypt a message: Select option 2 and enter the message you want to encrypt and public key. The program will use the public key to encrypt the message and display the encrypted message on the console.

Decrypt a message: Select option 3 and enter the encrypted message and private key. The program will use the private key to decrypt the message and display the decrypted message on the console.

Troubleshooting
If you get an error message when trying to decrypt a message, make sure that you have entered the correct private key or that the private key file path is correct.

Limitations
This is a simple implementation of RSA encryption and decryption and is intended for educational purposes only. It may not be suitable for use in production environments.
