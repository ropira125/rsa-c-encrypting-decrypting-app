This is a simple console application for RSA encryption and decryption in C#.

How to use:

Generate or regenerate public and private keys: Type <genkeys>.

Show currently used public and private keys: Type <showkeys>.

Encrypt a message: Type <enc> and enter the message you want to encrypt. The program will use the public key to encrypt the message and display the encrypted message on the console.

Decrypt a message: Type <dec> and enter the encrypted message. The program will use the private key to decrypt the message and display the decrypted message on the console.
